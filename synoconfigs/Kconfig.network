	help
		<DSM>No Bug Entry
		Switch net device name to collocate with hardware design.

config SYNO_MAX_SWITCHABLE_NET_DEVICE
	int "Max number of switch net device name"
	default 8
	depends on SYNO_SWITCH_NET_DEVICE_NAME
	help
		<DSM>No Bug Entry
		The max number of switching net device.

config SYNO_NET_DEVICE_ENCODING_LENGTH
	int "Encoding length of net device"
	default 6
	depends on SYNO_SWITCH_NET_DEVICE_NAME
	help
		<DSM>No Bug Entry
		The encoding length of switching net deivce.

config SYNO_SKIP_RXDROP_BY_CORE
	bool "Skip RX packets drop is increasing"
	default y
	help
		<Linux Kernel Porting - linux-2.6.38> #241
		rx_dropped counts packets dropped by driver and kernel core

config SYNO_BONDING_INIT_STATUS
	bool "Initial the bonding status"
	default y
	help
		<DSM> #33143
		The dev->operstate are not well initialized when bonding created.
		In bonding, the dev->operstate is not initialized after dev_init. So we call default_operstate() to init this value.

config SYNO_BONDING_FIX_ACTIVE
	bool "Fix a bug in active backup bonding mode"
	default y
	help
		<DSM> #74147
		While keep changing the MTU of a bonding interface in active backup mode,
		there is a chance that
		(1) the speed of the current active slave remains unknown, or
		(2) the current active slave is not actived
		Either case causes the speed of the current active slave remains unknown.
		If the speed of a bonding interface is unknown, its MTU can not
		be changed again using synonet tool.
		To solve the problem, this workaround changes the current active slave to
		the next upped NIC slave with correct speed.

config SYNO_IPV6_LINKLOCAL
	bool "Assign an interface to IPV6 link local address automatically."
	default y
	help
		<DSM> #14939, #47781
		For convenience, if there is no interface assigned to IPV6 link local address,
		a running interface is assigned automatically.
		But this workaround violates the IPV6 standard and may cause problem in the future.
