Freescale LS1024A clock bindings
================================

Required properties:

- compatible: Must be "fsl,ls1024a-clkcore", "syscon", "simple-mfd"
- reg: Address and length of device register set
- #clock-cells: Must be <1>
- fsl,ls1024a-bypass-workaround: phandle to the mmio-sram region in IRAM where
                                 the bootloader stored the clock generators
                                 state

Clock generator bypass bug workaround:

The clock generators for each device are affected by a bug, which prevents
reading the value of the bypass bit. To work around it, the bootloader keeps
a mirror of the bypass bits state in IRAM. The clock driver will read thah
state on init to determine the initial state of the clock generators. The
driver will then keep track of that bit state in its own internal structures,
allowing to free the IRAM region for other purposes.

Example:

	clkcore: clkcore@904b0000 {
		compatible = "fsl,ls1024a-clkcore",
			     "syscon", "simple-mfd";
		reg = <0x904b0000 0x400>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
		fsl,ls1024a-bypass-workaround = <&clk_bypass_bug>;
	};

The node in IRAM looks like this:
	iram: iram@83000000 {
		compatible = "mmio-sram";
		[...]

		clk_bypass_bug: clk_bypass_bug@fc00 {
			reg = <0xfc00 0x400>;
		};
	};
