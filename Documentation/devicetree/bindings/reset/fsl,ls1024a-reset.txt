Freescale LS1024A reset controller
==================================

Please also refer to reset.txt in this directory for common reset
controller binding usage.

The reset controller node must be a sub-node of the clock & reset
node on LS1024A SoC.

The reset specifier is the offset in number of bits relative to the
start of the clock and reset IO region.
To set bit b of register at offset o:
	(o << 3) | b
For instance, to reset the PFE using the bit 0 of the PFE_RESET
register at offset 0x108:
	(0x108 << 3) | 0 --> 0x840

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "fsl,ls1024a-reset"
- #reset-cells: must be set to 1

Example:

chip_rst: reset {
	compatible = "fsl,ls1024a-reset";
	#reset-cells = <1>;
};

&pfe {
	resets = <&chip_rst 0x840>;
	reset-names = "pfe";
};
