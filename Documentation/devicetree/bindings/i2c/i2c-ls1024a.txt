Freescale LS1024A I2C bus controller
====================================

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "fsl,ls1024a-i2c"
- reg: controller registers
- #address-cells: must be <1>
- #size-cells: must be <0>
- interrupts: the interrupt for the I2C controller
- clocks: the reference clock from which the bus clock will be derived
- resets: external I2C controller reset

Optional properties:
- clock-frequency:
    bus clock frequency to operate at, in hertz. This controller supports
    high-speed mode, which allows a bus frequency up to 3400000 Hz. If this
    property is not specified, the maximum frequency for standard I2C,
    100000 Hz is used.

Example:

i2c: i2c@9049c000 {
	compatible = "fsl,ls1024a-i2c";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	reg = <0x9049c000 0x20>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 30 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	resets = <&clkreset LS1024A_AXI_I2CSPI_RST>;
	clocks = <&clkcore LS1024A_CLK_I2CSPI>;
};
