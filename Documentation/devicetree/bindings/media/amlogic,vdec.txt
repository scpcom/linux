Amlogic Video Decoder
================================

The VDEC IP is composed of the following blocks :

- ESPARSER is a bitstream parser that outputs to a VIFIFO. Further VDEC blocks
then feed from this VIFIFO.
- VDEC_1 can decode MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4 part 2, H.263, H.264.
- VDEC_2 is used as a helper for corner cases like H.264 4K on older SoCs.
It is not handled by this driver.
- VDEC_HCODEC is the H.264 encoding block. It is not handled by this driver.
- VDEC_HEVC can decode HEVC and VP9.

VDEC: Video Decoder
--------------------------

Required properties:
- compatible: value should be different for each SoC family as :
	- GXBB (S905) : "amlogic,gxbb-vdec"
	- GXL (S905X, S905D) : "amlogic,gxl-vdec"
	- GXM (S912) : "amlogic,gxm-vdec"
- reg: base address and size of he following memory-mapped regions :
	- dos
	- esparser
- reg-names: should contain the names of the previous memory regions
- interrupts: should contain the vdec and esparser IRQs.
- amlogic,ao-sysctrl: should point to the AOBUS sysctrl node
- amlogic,canvas: should point to a canvas provider node
- clocks: should contain the following clocks :
	- dos_parser
	- dos
	- vdec_1
	- vdec_hevc
- clock-names: should contain the names of the previous clocks
- resets: should contain the parser reset.
- reset-names: should be "esparser".

Example:

vdec: video-decoder@c8820000 {
	compatible = "amlogic,gxbb-vdec";
	reg = <0x0 0xc8820000 0x0 0x10000>,
	      <0x0 0xc110a580 0x0 0xe4>;
	reg-names = "dos", "esparser";

	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 44 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
		     <GIC_SPI 32 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;

	amlogic,ao-sysctrl = <&sysctrl_AO>;
	amlogic,canvas = <&canvas>;

	clocks = <&clkc CLKID_DOS_PARSER>,
		 <&clkc CLKID_DOS>,
		 <&clkc CLKID_VDEC_1>,
		 <&clkc CLKID_VDEC_HEVC>;
	clock-names = "dos_parser", "dos", "vdec_1", "vdec_hevc";

	resets = <&reset RESET_PARSER>;
	reset-names = "esparser";
};
